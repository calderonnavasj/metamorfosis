The world has witnessed all kinds of miracles that the Eternal Father has performed. The psalmist delighted in remembering God's promises, wonders that he, too, had experienced. In addition to remembering them, he wanted to announce them from generation to generation until the end of his life, so that the name of the Almighty God would be heard, remembered and feared by everyone.",
