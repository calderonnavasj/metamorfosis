      "description":"Reflection: The apostle Peter took a mission trip to preach the gospel and visit believers in the Lydda region. In his itinerary Peter met a paralytic man to whom he said, \"Jesus Christ heals you\".  Immediately afterwards this man, who was known to have been paralyzed for 8 years, got up and walked, leaving all the people present astonished. The result of this miracle was the conversion of all who lived in Lydda and in Sharon. In addition to this incredible fact that inspired the conversion of men and women, there are three other outstanding facts. The first is that the apostle Peter was doing evangelistic and missionary work in the power of the Holy Spirit, just as the Lord commanded him.  The second is that the apostle Peter healed the paralytic in the name of Jesus Christ, and not in his own name or that of anyone else. And the third is that the apostle Peter must have received a special revelation from the Holy Spirit to tell the paralytic, \"Jesus Christ heals you, get up and fix your bed\", because Peter knew that the man would no longer be paralyzed.",
